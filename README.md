## Problem statement and Solution

Both businesses and individual consumers struggle with energy inefficiency. Unnecessary power consumption, poor scheduling, and lack of real-time information lead to higher costs and an increased carbon footprint. Consumers often leave appliances running longer than needed, while businesses fail to optimize resources and equipment usage.

Our AI-powered solution analyzes smart meter data, grid trends, and workplace activity to automate energy-saving decisions and optimize work schedules. By detecting wasteful energy consumption and patterns linked to inefficiency, our system provides smart recommendations that help both customers and businesses reduce energy consumption while improving sustainability.
