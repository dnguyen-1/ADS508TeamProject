Abstract:
Rising energy costs and workplace inefficiencies are driving the need for smarter solutions. Our AI-powered systems analyze real-time energy grid data, smart meters, and patterns to automate energy-saving decisions. By detecting waste and burnout risk, EcoGrid AI recommends smart shutdowns and efficiency boosts. Helping customers cut costs, lower carbon footprints, and enhance wellbeing.
Problem Statement:
Both businesses and individual consumers struggle with energy inefficiency. Unnecessary power consumption, poor scheduling, and lack of real-time information lead to higher costs and an increased carbon footprint. Consumers often leave appliances running longer than needed, while businesses fail to optimize resources and equipment usage.

Our AI-powered solution analyzes smart meter data, grid trends, and workplace activity to automate energy-saving decisions and optimize work schedules. By detecting wasteful energy consumption and patterns linked to inefficiency, our system provides smart recommendations that help both customers and businesses reduce energy consumption while improving sustainability.
